> So far I have the settings modal working and passing data to the map controller to be displayed.
> Map data is initialized in services. When a "set" is called on the Service, that set calls for Map to reinitialize. When reinitializing, it will pull the new data from the Service. 

> TODO:
>		Rest of the Settings (Whatever we decide they may be).
>		Get test locations.
>		Start implementation of "Filtering" based on test locations.
